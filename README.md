▪ Dataset and problem description 
  • Problem statement – To develop a system for automatic detection of 7 types of dry bean 
    seeds based on data captured using a high-resolution camera.

Approach - In the given scenario, the primary aim is to develop machine learning models to classify the different varieties of dry beans. Our requirement is to classify the dry beans into 7 distinct types of beans that are provided in the given dataset. This dataset is based on the study performed on 7 unique types of beans based on their physical attributes. This report will focus on the implementing machine learning model to perform multiclass classification of seven types of dry beans from the provided dry bean dataset. In this report, I will be implementing  Multi-layer Perceptron and K nearest neighbors. In this report we will discuss the working of these models and evaluate each model using evaluation metrics. Then we will discuss the best model among the two models.
